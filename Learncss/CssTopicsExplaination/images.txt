For images Mentioning WXH is common practise
*use square image for round profile set --> border-radius:50%
*background-image: url()--> can add url local or online resource to show bg image
transparency images url() helps to show the bg color we set it like background-color:red mix well and give a different vibe;
** control Bg image
background-repeat: norepeat,x-repeat,y-repeat,repeat(default-behaviour);
backround-size: cover (for big scene photos helps to cover almost the img) like contain (contain whole image);
background-position: which helps to coverd size which part to show(top,bottom,left,right,center)

simple way
backround: repeat position url, repeat  position url 

**
text-shadow : helps to give shadow to our text so the content visiblity in foreground to background much clear. 2px,2px,2px, black
background-color: shadow transition help to give transition effect use rgba or hsla

*****Linear gradient***
give two colors and it transform one to other linearly 
background-image: Linear-gradient(to left, steelblue, white); --> left,right,bootom,right helps to which side the transform occurs


*****Radila gradient****
which helps to transform one to other radiantly
